/* CODEX-8 deploy-path guard.
   Everything under app/public ships verbatim to arborparentingapp.com on the
   next hosting deploy. Marketing pages are brand-facing product claims, so the
   marketing folder is allowlist-only: a page that has not been explicitly
   approved here must NOT be able to ride along into production (the way the
   unvalidated Third-Age senior landing page once did).

   To publish a new marketing page: get the go-live decision first, then add
   the file to the allowlist below in the same PR that adds the page. */
